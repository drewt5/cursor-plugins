# Set up Benny

Benny ships as a dormant automation pack inside pstack. The plugin manifest exposes only pstack's normal skill root; this file and the two operational files are not slash skills.

The human enters setup by pointing the active agent at the pack's `FOR_AGENTS.md`. The bootstrap flow copies the whole pack into the target repository, then reads this file directly at `.pstack/automations/benny/skills/setup-benny/SKILL.md`.

Benny needs external configuration and two configured automation jobs or explicit foreground runs.

Do not create or update an automation until the user explicitly asks. Never put a secret value in plugin files, prompts, or committed configuration.

## 1. Copy the pack and enable shared pstack skills

Do this before asking for Benny configuration and before configuring a supported runner.

Ask which repository will run the automations. The source pack is the directory containing `FOR_AGENTS.md`. The destination is `<target-repository>/.pstack/automations/benny/`.

Merge the entire source pack into the destination:

1. Create the destination when it is absent.
2. Copy every source file to the same relative path.
3. Preserve destination-only files. Never delete unrelated files during install or refresh.
4. Keep user-owned configuration, feature maps, and routing maps outside the destination. Never overwrite them.
5. When an existing source-managed file differs, inspect the diff and merge without discarding local edits. If ownership is ambiguous, stop and ask before replacing it.
6. Verify that the destination contains `FOR_AGENTS.md`, this setup file, both operational files, their references, and the templates.

If this file is already being read from the target destination, treat the copy as complete and run the same verification before continuing.

Install shared pstack skills for the runner's active host using the portable installer, or provide the committed package to a remote runner. Verify a fresh runner can read `how`, `why`, `tdd`, `unslop`, and the required principle skills. Do not rely on this setup session's plugin cache or credentials.

Benny's operational files are read directly from `.pstack/automations/benny/`. They are not slash skills. For remote jobs, commit the pack and secret-free configuration on the branch used by the runner before enabling it. Do not commit without authorization. A local foreground run can use the verified local files.

## 2. Adapt the configuration

Open these copied examples:

- `../../templates/configuration.example.yaml`
- `../reproduce-and-fix-issues/references/feature-map.example.md`

Create user-owned copies outside `.pstack/automations/benny/`. These are configuration files, not pack files. Example locations:

- Project config, such as `.pstack/benny/configuration.yaml`
- Project feature map, such as `.pstack/benny/feature-map.md`
- Project routing map, such as `.pstack/benny/routing.md`
- User config, such as `~/.config/benny/configuration.yaml`
- User feature map, such as `~/.config/benny/feature-map.md`

Fill one feature-map section for every user-facing feature the automation may reproduce. Keep it at the user point of view. Do not freeze implementation details or current code paths in the map.

Do not edit the copied examples. Pack refreshes may update source-managed files after conflict review, but they must never touch the user-owned copies.

Prefer committed, secret-free files in the target repository when a fresh automation checkout must read them. Otherwise paraphrase the required values into the live prompt. Reference a repository file only after git confirms that the file is committed in the repository where the automation runs.

Use stable repository-relative paths for committed pack and configuration files. Never reference the plugin source directory or a plugin cache path from a live automation.

## 3. Fill the required choices

Ask for or confirm:

- Source Slack channel ID
- Optional operations or status channel ID
- Repository URL and default branch
- Triage identity or Slack user ID
- Issue tracker type, team, project, labels, and intake status
- Tracker adapter skill or MCP actions
- Optional routing map path
- Required control skill name
- Required user-facing feature-map path
- Status emoji strings
- Pull request URL format
- Polling and effort budgets
- Model slug for triage, repro, code work, and media review

Use only model slugs shown as available in the runner's supported model list. Do not guess a slug and do not carry over a private default.

The source channel, triage identity, repository, tracker adapter, control skill, and feature map must be explicit. Fail setup if any required value stays ambiguous.

Use pstack's `unslop` skill on the final automation names, descriptions, and prompt shims before saving them.

## 4. Check integration capabilities

The triage automation needs:

- Read access to the configured source Slack channel and its threads
- Thread-reply access in that channel
- Attachment metadata and file download access when reports include media
- Search, read, create, and update access through the configured issue-tracker adapter

The repro automation needs:

- Read access to the source thread
- Thread-reply access in the source channel
- Optional post and edit access in the configured operations channel
- Repository read and history access
- A pull request action that can open a draft pull request
- The configured control-adapter skill

Prefer configured Slack connector actions for reads and posts. The optional `BENNY_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` may fill a narrow gap such as editing one operations status message or downloading an attachment. Store the value in a secret manager or environment, not in YAML.

Do not use undocumented integration endpoints.

## 5. Prepare the routing map

If the user wants reroutes or owner pings:

1. Copy `../triage-issue-reports/references/routing.example.md` outside `.pstack/automations/benny/`.
2. Replace every placeholder with public or organization-local values.
3. Keep owner pings off by default.
4. Allow a ping only for a configured feature owner or a confirmed likely regression author.

If no routing map is configured, triage may classify a report but must not guess a destination or owner.

## 6. Verify the control adapter

Read `../reproduce-and-fix-issues/references/control-adapter.md` and the user's completed feature map.

Confirm that the named skill can:

- Bring up the target app
- Navigate every mapped feature through the real UI
- Exercise mapped states through declared adapter actions
- Inspect state without forcing the result
- Capture screenshots
- Start and stop a recording
- Clean up its processes and temporary data

If any capability is missing, leave the repro automation disabled. It must fail closed rather than claim a reproduction it did not perform.

## 7. Prepare the runner

Read `../../FOR_AGENTS.md` and the matching prompt templates. Select a scheduler that is actually configured and supports the required Slack event payload. Use its documented creation/update interface only after the user asks to enable or update jobs. Existing jobs must be updated by identity, not duplicated.

Each job needs its name, repository and branch, exact committed operational-file path, source channel, immutable thread coordinates, scoped connector access, model choice, timeout, and failure destination. Keep credentials in the runner's secret store. Model identifiers must be supported by that runner; inheritance is the default.

- Triage reads `.pstack/automations/benny/skills/triage-issue-reports/SKILL.md`, classifies a new top-level report, checks existing issues, and posts a trusted verdict marker only in the source thread.
- Repro reads `.pstack/automations/benny/skills/reproduce-and-fix-issues/SKILL.md`, waits for the trusted marker, reproduces twice through the configured driver, and optionally prepares a bounded draft fix with proof.

If no scheduler is available, prepare two foreground instructions naming those files and a concrete report's channel and thread coordinates. Execute only when requested. Do not claim event-driven processing is active. No invented automation tool, editor, or host deep link is a substitute for an actual runner.

Review the completed job definitions and obtain any required authorization before enabling external actions. Keep normal traffic disabled until the thread-safety test passes.

## 8. Test thread safety

Use a test channel or a harmless test report.

Before testing, confirm that the target repository's shared pstack skills, `.pstack/automations/benny/`, and every referenced secret-free configuration file are available locally for a foreground run or committed on the branch used by a remote automation checkout. Confirm that both live prompts point at their exact committed operational files. If any check fails, stop. Tell the user that the automation cannot be enabled yet.

Verify:

1. Triage stores the root `thread_ts` and posts exactly one verdict as a reply.
2. The verdict contains one configured marker.
3. Repro accepts the marker only from the configured triage identity.
4. Repro keeps the same immutable source coordinates.
5. No source-channel root message appears.
6. A delegated worker cannot use any Slack write action.
7. Missing coordinates, a deleted parent, or a failed preflight produces no post and no tracker issue.

Enable normal traffic only after all seven checks pass.
